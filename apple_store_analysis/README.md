Business Objective

The purpose of this analysis is to simulate a scenario where we are data analysts at Apple, tasked with providing insights on:
	â€¢	Free vs Paid App Distributions
	â€¢	Genre-based Performance
	â€¢	High-Rated Apps Patterns
	â€¢	Size and Pricing Trends

Each query is designed to reflect a real business question that could inform product, marketing, or monetization strategies.

Tableau Visualization Dashboard

I have created a Tableau Public Dashboard to visualize key insights from the SQL analysis.

ðŸ”— Tableau Dashboard Link

Current Visuals:
	1.	App Count by Genre
	2.	Average User Rating per Genre
	3.	(More visualizations will be added as the analysis progresses)

â¸»

How to Use This Repository
	1.	Clone the repository.
	2.	Run the SQL scripts in order from 001 to 024.
	3.	Optional: Connect Tableau to the PostgreSQL DB and replicate the visualizations.

â¸»

Next Steps
	â€¢	Add more advanced visualizations to Tableau.
	â€¢	Perform cohort analysis on app versions and update frequencies.
	â€¢	Analyze correlations between app size, price, and rating.
